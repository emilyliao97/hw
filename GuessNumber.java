  class GuessNumber -- fun fun fun!

  eg, sample interaction with end user:
  Guess a # fr 1-100: 50
  Too high
  Guess a # fr 1-49: 25
  Too low
  Guess a # fr 26-49: 38
  Correct! It took 3 guesses
  ==================================================*/

/*==================================================
  the Breakdown:

  Start off with two given numbers, the lower and upper bounds.
  Start the game by allowing for the player to pick one number.
  Base Case: Target is equal to the guess. Ctr ++
  If the number is too high, then set the _hi equal to the guess -1 and keep playing until number is equal. Ctr ++
  If the number is too low, then set the _lo equal to the guess +1 and keep playing until number is equal. Ctr ++

      THE BIG Q's:

      1. What is the max # of guesses if num is b/t 1 & 100?
      7, because you can continuously divide by 2 to get closer to the number.
      7 is the greatest power of 2 greater than 100.

      2. What is the max # of guesses if num is b/t 1 & 200?
      8, based on the same reasoning as above.
      In addition, you can get to the case with 100 in 1 guess.

      3. What is the max # of guesses if num is b/t 1 & 400?
      9. You can easily go from 400 to the case in 200 with one guess.
      Therefore, all you have to do is add 1.

      4. What is the max # of guesses if num is b/t 1 & 1000?
      10, by the same reasoning as above. :)

      5. What is the max # of guesses if num is b/t 1 & n?
      The max number of guesses would be the ceiling of log base 2 n.
